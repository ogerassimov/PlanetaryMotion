# Planetary Motion

## Planetary motion based on three Kepler's laws. 

### Abstract

The aim of this project is to explain how to calculate a planet position at certain moment of time, knowing all 6 mandatory orbit elements of that planet.
Mathematics explained with mathematical proofs with testing source code in python and as well a working source code in python provided as reference implementation  - free of use from anyone. 

#### Scope
At the moment only the closed orbits are supported - ellipse. In the future open orbits like parabola and hyperbola would be also added. 
In this work the second task is not included, from observation to determine the orbital parameters, probably that part would be in another project

#### Content
It explains mathematics with mathematical proofs, as well as provides demonstration source code and tests for validation of the mathematical approach and source code.

A program that can calculate the position of a planet in certain moment of time, knowing the orbital elements of the planet. 

A program that can calculate ephemeris of a planet - coordinates at Earth sky for obvervations. (This is planned but not entirely implemented yet)

#### Mathematical part

It explain in detail how to use three Kepler's laws and it contains all essencial proofs very detaily.

#### Checking and Testing

Demonstration programs are provided for each step validating that the approach is giving the correct result, for checking data is used JPL and Minor Planet Center.

#### Demo program that calculates coordinates

Implemented in python a program that calculates the position of a planet as coordinates in 3-dimentional Space. 

Next step is to provide program that could calculate ephemeris, the coordinates at the Earth's Sky for observation of a planet.
